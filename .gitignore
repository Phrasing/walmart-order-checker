# Compiled binaries for the current project
# (e.g., when running `go build`)
# Adjust this to match your project's output names
# e.g., if your main executable is `my-app`, add `my-app`
# For a typical project, you might ignore the project name itself
# if it's built in the root directory.
# If you build into a `bin/` directory, you might ignore `bin/`
# e.g., /bin/
# or specific binaries within it: /bin/my-app
